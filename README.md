- "I'd like something fruity and refreshing"

**Happy Hour**:
- "Is it happy hour?"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (bartender_agent.py)
- Built on SignalWire's AgentBase class
- Implements SWAIG functions for drink operations
- Uses TF-IDF for fuzzy drink matching (optional)
- Manages conversation flow through state contexts
- Sends real-time events to frontend

### Frontend (web/)
- Single-page application with real-time updates
- WebRTC connection for voice communication
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Bar-themed UI with elegant styling

### Key Components

#### SWAIG Functions
- `add_drink`: Add drinks to customer's tab
- `remove_drink`: Remove items from tab
- `review_tab`: Display current tab status
- `check_happy_hour`: Check happy hour status
- `close_tab`: Process payment and close tab

#### Conversation States
1. **greeting**: Welcome and initial order
2. **taking_order**: Main ordering phase
3. **closing_tab**: Payment processing
4. **tab_closed**: Post-payment state

#### User Events
Events sent from backend to frontend for UI updates:
- `drink_added`: New drink added to tab
- `drink_removed`: Item removed from tab
- `tab_review`: Full tab sync
- `tab_closed`: Payment completed
- `happy_hour_status`: Happy hour status update

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Drinks

Edit the `DRINKS` dictionary in `bartender_agent.py`:

```python
"C011": {
    "name": "Espresso Martini",
    "price": 14.00,
    "description": "Vodka, coffee liqueur, espresso",
    "abv": 20,
    "category": "cocktail"
}
```

### Modifying Happy Hour

Adjust times and discount in `.env`:
```env
HAPPY_HOUR_START=15  # 3 PM
HAPPY_HOUR_END=20    # 8 PM
HAPPY_HOUR_DISCOUNT=0.25  # 25% off
```

### Changing the Bartender's Personality

Edit the personality section in `bartender_agent.py`:
```python
self.prompt_add_section(
    "Personality",
    "Your custom personality description here..."
)
```

## üîä Audio Feedback

The agent uses audio files for ambient feedback:
- `/pouring.mp3` - When adding drinks
- `/clearing.mp3` - When removing items
- `/calculating.mp3` - When reviewing tab
- `/payment.mp3` - When processing payment

Place these files in your SignalWire assets directory.

## üìä Responsible Service Features

Built-in safety features include:
- Maximum 5 drinks per customer session
- Maximum 2 drinks per hour monitoring
- Automatic water suggestions after 3 alcoholic drinks
- Service refusal when limits are reached

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify SignalWire credentials in `.env`
- Check token in `web/app.js` is valid
- Ensure port 3030 is not in use
- Check firewall settings

### No Audio
- Allow microphone permissions in browser
- Check SignalWire project has voice enabled
- Verify WebRTC connection established

### Events Not Updating UI
